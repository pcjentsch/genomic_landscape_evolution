## Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that reduce binding by antibodies or sera
Visualization of how mutations to the RBD affect antibody or sera binding made using the deep mutational scanning approach [described here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820306247).

The measurements are projected on [the crystal structure of the RBD bound to ACE2](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J).

See [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps) for more details.
